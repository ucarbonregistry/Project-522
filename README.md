# Project-522
2.2 MW hydropower plant in Birsinghpur, Madhya Pradesh of Ascent Hydro Projects Limited (AHPL)

Country : India

State : Madhya Pradesh

District : Umaria

Tehsil : Pali

Village : Mangthar

This project location is situated near village Mangthar of Umaria district in the state of Madhya
Pradesh. The nearest railway station to plant is Birsinghpur Railway Station located about 8km,
which is on Bhopal -Bilaspur railway route. The district headquarters is at Umaria, which is about 40
kilometers from the plant. The geographic coordinate of the project location- 23.36º N and 81.03º E.

The Unit 1 of the project activity has started commercial operation from 24/10/2006 whereas the
Unit II of the project activity has started commercial operation from 06/02/2007. The plant has
synchronized with the grid in July 2006. 

The proposed project tile under UCR is “2.2 MW hydropower plant in Birsinghpur, Madhya Pradesh
of Ascent Hydro Projects Limited (AHPL)”, which is a grid connected Hydro Electric Power project
located in Umaria district in the state of Madhya Pradesh (India). The project is an operational activity
with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry”
(UCR).

The proposed project activity is promoted by Ascent Hydro Projects Ltd (AHPPL) (herein after called
as project proponent ‘PP’). The proposed project activity is installation and operation of 2 Horizontal
Kaplan turbines having individual capacity 1102 kW with aggregated installed capacity of 2.2 MW
in Vill - Mangthar, Taluka - Pali, District - Umaria, Madhya Pradesh state of India. The project activity,
“Birsinghpur hydroelectric project” is located within the premises of Sanjay Gandhi Thermal Power
Station (SGTPS) owned and operated by Madhya Pradesh Power Generating Company Ltd
(MPPGCL), formerly Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board (MPSEB). This is an existing
operational project.

The main purpose of the project activity is to utilize condenser-cooling water and available head
between the water level in the seal pit and the water level in the return canal for the generation of
electricity. SGTPS has four operating units of 210 MW each. SGTPS operates on the lake cooling
system in which, the water is conveyed in a canal to the circulating water pump house. The water is
then circulated through the cooling condensers of the steam generating units by the circulating water
pumps. After cooling the steam in the condensers, the water is discharged to the seal pit. The water
then flows back to the reservoir by gravity through the return canal. About 30,000 cubic metres per
hour (m3/hr) of water is required for cooling the condensers. Three (3) pumps each having a
discharging capacity of 10,000 m3/hr at 25 metres head are employed to draw water from the lake.
AHPL is a subsidiary of Dodson–Lindblom International Inc. (DLI), an USA-based water resources
company involved in developing and operation of hydroelectric plants. AHPL is operating a 2.2 MW
small hydroelectric project at Birsinghpur in Madhya Pradesh on Build, Own, Operate and Maintain
(BOOM) basis for thirty years starting from 24/10/2006. 
__________
PRIOR HISTORY
__________
The project activity is a small-scale hydro project, following are the key details under the prior history
of the project:

(a).The project activity is a small-scale hydro project which is registered under CDM with CDM
project ID 1280 titled “2.2 MW hydropower plant in Birsinghpur, Madhya Pradesh of Ascent
Hydro Projects Limited (AHPL)”. 1The project has received CERs for all three crediting
periods lasting from 25/11/2007 to 31/12/2020. Apart from CDM; the project has not achieved
any registration or issuance under any other GHG mechanism.

(b).The project was not applied under any other GHG mechanism, also for the current period of
COUs, the CDM verification has also not been initiated. Hence project will not cause double
accounting of carbon credits (i.e., COUs).
